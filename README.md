# TriviaGame

The game starts off with an intro that copies the STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL's actual intro, complete with totally not Star Wars  music!
Fortunately for you, the intro is skippable.

The main game has 13 multiple choice questions.  You have 10 seconds to answer a question, or it will be counted as unanswered.
Correctly answer all 13 to unlock the bonus button on the results page!

All images were taken from my copy of the STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL.
Intro music is from http://www.smartsound.com/royalty-free-music/library/Cinema+Standards/Worlds+Beyond/

I added a media query to adjust the size of the main game to fit monitors with low resolutions (read: my laptop).
